# Quantum Transfer Learning ‚Äì Workshop

- Welcome to our the result of our first workshop series at UMD - **Quantum Transfer Learning**<br>
- This workshop series is based on recreating and improving a quantum transfer learning demo from PennyLane.
- What we accomplished together: **Worked together to propose, implement, and review improvements** to the original recreated code.

> Contributors' experience levels ranged from never having used Python, to conducting quantum research with us, all contributors are given credit for their specific contributions below and references are listed.

## üöÄ Workshop Overvew

This is the result of two workshops we conducted, each 90 minutes long.
- Workshop #1: We setup programming environments, grouped up into teams of 2 or 4, and recreated Pennylane's demo with support from members of Do Quantum @ UMD's leadership team ([Evren](https://github.com/EvrenKissane) and [Wilson](https://github.com/0mWh)).
- Workshop #2: We worked together to propose, implement, and review improvements to the original recreated code.

## üí° Improvement Ideas

Here are some improvement ideas you can work on:
- Address overfitting and underfitting (early stopping, regularization, etc.)
- Balance the dataset (oversampling, augmentation)
- Add or improve evaluation metrics (precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- Enhance visualization (e.g., training and validation curves)
- Refactor code for readability (comments, modularization)
- Optimize hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size)
